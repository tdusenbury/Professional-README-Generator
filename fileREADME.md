## Description 

This application will produce a high-quality, professional README.md with the title of your project and sections for Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Constributing, Tests, and Questions. By following the prompts and adding the requested information, all the appropriate sections will be written into the appropriate file format and populate the above-stated sections. Additionally, the application gives you a list of licenses to choose from and displays the associated badge and license name.

## Installation

## Code Example

I had a lot of issues with this code. I finally was able to populate all the fields separately, but I did a total git failure and didn't push up. I was unable to get back to where I was and each section now overlaps one or the other.

## Usage 

When up and running, this would be a great tool for creating study questions for review as they were studying each night. You could create one for each applicable class. With more skills, the questions could be randomized to ensure greatest challenge.


## Learning Points 

This was another project that utilized JavaScript. I learned from my last project to approach each part section by section. I did start off really well and was remembering to git commit regularly.  I created an array that initially loaded to my quiz screen and rotated throught the questions. I then added the high score page and tried to complete the hidden/visible styles on each section. Somewhere in there I both forgot to git commit and I tried to do too many things at once and lost control.

Frankly, I thought I had it because I did understand how to create each part, but I got cocky and forgot to follow best practices.

At the same time, I have to remind myself that just over two weeks ago I had zero experience with this kind of work. This application may not actually do everything that it is supposed to, but what I did create is not far from being useful. 

I look forward to learning more and then coming back to this when the cohort is over and debugging and refactoring my work.

I am also learning that I really enjoy the styling aspect of this work.

PS This will forever be the project I was working on when my son completed his Eagle Project.
